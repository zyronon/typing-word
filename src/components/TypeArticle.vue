      How does the older investor differ in his approach to investment from the younger investor?
      There is no shortage of tipsters around offering 'get-rich-quick' opportunities. But if you are a serious private
      investor, leave the Las Vegas mentality to those with money to fritter. The serious investor needs a proper
      'portfolio' -- a well-planned selection of investments, with a definite structure and a clear aim. But exactly how
      does a newcomer to the stock market go about achieving that?
      Well, if you go to five reputable stock brokers and ask them what you should do with your money, you're likely to
      get five different answers, -- even if you give all the relevant information about your age age, family, finances
      and what you want from your investments. Moral? There is no one 'right' way to structure a portfolio. However,
      there are undoubtedly some wrong ways, and you can be sure that none of our five advisers would have suggested
      sinking all (or perhaps any) of your money into Periwigs*.
      So what should you do? We'll assume that you have sorted out the basics -- like mortgages, pensions, insurance and
      access to sufficient cash reserves. You should then establish your own individual aims. These are partly a matter
      of personal circumstances, partly a matter of psychology.
      For instance, if you are older you have less time to recover from any major losses, and you may well wish to boost
      your pension income. So preserving your capital and generating extra income are your main priorities. In this
      case, you'd probably construct a portfolio with some shares (but not high risk ones), along with gilts, cash
      deposits, and perhaps convertibles or the income shares of split capital investment trusts.
      If you are younger, and in a solid financial position, you may decide to take an aggressive approach -- but only
      if you're blessed with a sanguine disposition and won't suffer sleepless nights over share prices. If portfolio,
      alongside your more pedestrian in vestments. Once you have decided on your investment aims, you can then decide
      where to put your money. The golden rule here is spread your risk -- if you put all of your money into Periwigs
      International, you're setting yourself up as a hostage to fortune.
      *'Periwigs' is the name of a fictitious company.
